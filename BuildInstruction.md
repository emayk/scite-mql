# Introduction #

The project consists of 3 separate programs: scite editor, RefreshCrapT4, and MetaEditorXmlParser. Each have its own build methods


# Scite #

source code resides in scintilla directory, in order to compile it please consult scintilla/scintilla/README, personally I used TDM-GCC to compile the editor.

# RefreshCrapT4 #

this program is used to notify mt4 to refresh EA/script/indicator lists. source code resides in RefreshCrapT4 folder, you can compile it with Visual Studio 2010+, just open the solution file.

# MetaEditorXmlParser #

this program is a utility program that extracts MT4 help xml (which is not XML compliant) and build the chm file and other stuff. Use Visual Studio 2010+ to compile.
